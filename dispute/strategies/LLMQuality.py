Study the examples the user gives you as they will be very informative for how to do the task.
Donâ€™t worry about factuality with respect to the real world, just judge the example based on what you see. 
No need to overthink this task, it really comes down to just soft matching.

Provided Answer: The main constituent of anthracite is carbon. High-grade anthracite, for example, has a chemical formula represented by CHONS, indicating it contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, with carbon making up 94% of its composition. Ultra high-grade (UHG) anthracite typically has a minimum carbon content of 95%, further emphasizing carbon as the primary element in anthracite.
Answer: Carbon
