We then pass these values to the `replacePlaceholders()` method, which iterates over the entries in the `replacements` map and replaces each placeholder in the input string with its corresponding value using the `replace()` method. Finally, the `replacePlaceholders()` method returns the modified string, which is printed to the console.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```csharp\nThis is a new student at point 3, 4\n```\nNote that you can modify the `replacements` map to include additional placeholders and their corresponding values, and the `replacePlaceholders()` method will automatically replace them in the input string.',

So when the `getline` function is called to read the `player_sex` string, it immediately reads the newline character left in the input stream and stops reading, resulting in an empty string being stored in the `player_sex` variable.\n\nTo avoid this issue, the `getline` function is called again after reading the integer value, this time storing the input in the `dummy` variable.
